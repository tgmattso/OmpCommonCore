This directory holds all the code taken from our book:


     The OpenMP Common Core: making OpenMP Simple again

There are 2 subdirectories: C and Fortran. 

The naming conventions are: Fig_x.x_name_C or Fig_x.x_name.c, and 
the corresponding _Fortran, or *.f, or *.f90, such as Fig_1.1_helloworld.c 
and Fig_1.1_helloworld.f90. "x.x" is the figure number in the book, 
and "name" is the label used in the latex source file of the book 
for this figure.

 _C or _Fortran means the code is not complete, thus could not be compiled.

*.c, *.f90, *.f are codes that are complete and could be compiled.  If 
a code has external functions that are not defined, or is just a subroutine, 
then it can only be built with the "-c" flag to generate an object file, 
and I add a comment in the source code for these.

A few codes also have Fig_x.x_name_full.c and Fig_x.x_name_full.f90. 
This is to provide full codes (more than what we show in the book).

There are a few extra Chxx_pgyy_code_C or Chxx_pgyy_code_Fortran codes.  
These are code segments in the book in Chapter xx, Page 77, that are not a figure.
